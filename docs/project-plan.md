# AI Workout Generator with Hevy Integration - Project Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Initial Architecture

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up a basic web application structure using a modern JavaScript framework (React)
   - Initialize repository with proper structure (frontend, backend)
   - Set up development environment with necessary dependencies

2. **API Exploration & Documentation**
   - Document the Hevy API endpoints relevant to your project
   - Identify authentication methods required for Hevy
   - Understand Claude API requirements for programmatic access
   - Define data schemas for information exchange between systems

3. **Core Architecture Design**
   - Design the application flow and component structure
   - Plan database schema for storing user data, workout history, and preferences
   - Create wireframes for the user interface
   - Establish authentication flow for both Claude and Hevy services

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Development

1. **Authentication Module**
   - Implement secure user authentication system
   - Develop integration with Hevy API authentication
   - Set up Claude API authentication
   - Create token management system for maintaining sessions

2. **Hevy Integration**
   - Develop API client for Hevy
   - Implement functions to fetch workout history and stats
   - Create functions to add new workouts to Hevy
   - Build data transformation utilities to standardize formats

3. **Claude AI Integration**
   - Implement Claude API client
   - Create prompt templates for workout generation
   - Develop context management to include historical performance data
   - Build response parser to extract structured workout data

4. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Create workflow for gathering Hevy workout data
   - Develop transformation logic for feeding data to Claude
   - Implement parsing of Claude responses into Hevy-compatible format
   - Build validation system to ensure data integrity

## Phase 3: User Interface & Experience

1. **Frontend Development**
   - Implement responsive UI for web application
   - Create dashboard for viewing workout history and stats
   - Build workout request interface
   - Develop visualization components for progress tracking

2. **Workflow Automation**
   - Implement automated data synchronization between systems
   - Create scheduled tasks for regular updates
   - Develop notification system for new workout plans
   - Build error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Phase 4: Testing & Refinement

1. **Testing Strategy**
   - Develop unit tests for critical components
   - Implement integration tests for API connections
   - Create end-to-end tests for complete workflows
   - Build monitoring system for tracking application health

2. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Set up analytics to track application usage
   - Create feedback mechanisms
   - Implement iterative improvements based on your usage patterns
   - Refine AI prompts based on workout effectiveness

## Phase 5: Preparation for Scaling

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize API requests to minimize rate limit impacts
   - Enhance frontend performance
   - Refine database queries for efficiency

2. **Infrastructure Planning**
   - Design scalable hosting architecture
   - Plan authentication and authorization for multi-user support
   - Define privacy controls and data ownership boundaries
   - Prepare documentation for potential users

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (for flexible schema as you evolve the application)
- **Authentication**: JWT with OAuth for third-party services
- **Hosting**: Initially Vercel or Netlify, with plans to migrate to AWS or GCP when scaling
- **API Management**: Axios for API requests
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux depending on complexity
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS for styling

## Initial Implementation Steps

1. Set up a new Next.js project
2. Create API routes for handling authentication and proxy requests to Hevy
3. Implement Claude API integration with proper context management
4. Build data transformation utilities between systems
5. Create basic UI for requesting workouts and viewing history
6. Implement authentication flow connecting both services
7. Develop automated workout transfer functionality
